These files contain tests of different ScratchR functionality created with Selenium. The main test suite is ScratchR-Suite.html. 

To install the Selenium plugin on your firefox browser, download the Selenium IDE from this page: http://seleniumhq.org/download/

Then open the test suite, and run the tests.

It's useful to have the firebug plugin installed as well, so you can see what's being tested / going on: http://getfirebug.com/
