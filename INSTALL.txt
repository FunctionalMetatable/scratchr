1. Install the latest stable versions of Apache, MySQL and PHP and Memcache
(XAMP or WAMP are good options for Windows that come with all of them).
Apache needs mod-rewrite enabled and PHP needs php5-mysql

2. Install an SVN client on your computer
(for Windows I recommend TortoiseSVN)

3. Do an "svn checkout" of our code:
   svn co http://svn.assembla.com/svn/scratchr

4. Create a MySQL database based on sql/db-structure.sql:
    mysql -u root -p name_of_database < app/config/sql/db-structure.sql
   Execute all SQL files you find under app/config/sql/updates one by one (if any)
   (first sort all the files by modified/filename to maintain the right order)
    
5. Based on app/config/database.php.default create
configuration file called app/config/database.php with the
approrpiate access info for your database.

6. Install memcached:
    apt-get install memcached (for Ubuntu)
   Enable the memcached extension for PHP
   Start memcached daemon:
    memcached -d
   Set your memcache configuration in app/config/bootstrap.php:
    define("MEMCACHE_SERVER", 'localhost');  //memcache server
    define("MEMCACHE_PORT", 11211);  //memcache port
   
7. Configure Apache to point to app/webroot

8. Make app/tmp/ directory writable

9. Send an email to andresmh@media.mit.edu letting us know that you have
